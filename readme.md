# AWT (Amazing Website Testing)
This is a tool that lets you test websites on computer/android or both. When you save the code it refreshes.

# Download
First you need to install ADB with `winget install Google.PlatformTools`
Second you need to enable developer options and then enable USB debugging. (optional enable stay awake)
Last you need to install AWT from the releases section on Github.

# Other platforms (Linux/Macos)
I don't know if MacOS works as I don't have a computer with MacOS on it. And I don't know if Linux works because I haven't tried it.
